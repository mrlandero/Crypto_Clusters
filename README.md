## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

**[Pandas Library](https://pandas.pydata.org/)** - a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool.<br>

**[HVPlot Library](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/)** - A high-level plotting API for the PyData ecosystem built on HoloViews.<br>

**[Pathlib Library](https://pathlib.readthedocs.io/en/pep428/)** - offers a set of classes featuring all the common operations on paths in an easy, object-oriented way.<br>

**[SKLearn.cluster Library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html)** - Clustering of unlabeled data can be performed with the module sklearn.cluster.<br>

**[SKLearn.decomposition Library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html)** - Principal component analysis (PCA) - Linear dimensionality reduction using Singular Value Decomposition of the data to project it to a lower dimensional space.<br>

**[SKLearn.preprocessing Library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html)** - StandardScalar - Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.<br>
